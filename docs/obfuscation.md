# Obfuscation

A cluster can hide parts of its records from everyone browsing it, so a topic
stays debuggable without showing card numbers or emails in cleartext. Rules are
per topic, compiled at boot, and applied inside the scan, before filters and
before anything is rendered.

```yaml
obfuscation:
  # Required as soon as one rule hashes. Base64 or plain text, 32 bytes or more.
  secret: ${KLENS_OBFUSCATION_SECRET}
  rules:
    # Field rules walk the JSON a registry decode produced.
    - topics: ["payments.*"] # exact name, or a trailing-* prefix
      fields:
        - path: card.number
          strategy: hash # deterministic token: kx:3f9a2c481b7d6e05
        - path: card.cvv
          strategy: drop # the field disappears
        - path: customer.email
          strategy: mask # ***
      # A value that never decoded cannot be walked. Default: mask it whole.
      unparsed: mask # mask | allow
    # Whole-field rules, for topics browsed as raw text.
    - topics: ["audit.raw"]
      key: mask
      value: hash
      headers: ["x-user-id"] # header values to mask, by name
    # Pattern rules, for schemaless text topics no registry decodes.
    - topics: ["app.logs"]
      patterns:
        - regex: '\b\d{13,19}\b'
          strategy: hash
        - regex: '[\w.+-]+@[\w-]+\.[\w.]+'
          strategy: mask
```

A path met by an array fans out over its elements, so `items.sku` covers every
element's `sku`. `hash` is `HMAC-SHA256` truncated to 64 bits: equal values
render as equal tokens, so records stay correlatable, but the token cannot be
enumerated back without the secret. Rotating the secret changes every token.

Field rules only reach JSON a registry decode produced. Pattern rules reach the
rendered text of key and value instead, which is all a schemaless topic ever
has: every match is replaced by its strategy's output, and `drop` deletes the
match. They only run on topics a rule names, never by detection — and they are
the weaker of the two, because a value written in an unexpected format slips
past the regex. Use field rules wherever a schema exists.

Filters see the obfuscated record, not the wire record: a `contains`
filter over a protected field matches the token, never the value behind it.
That is deliberate — a filter that searched the cleartext would recover a
hidden value one character at a time. What the page can show is what a query
can search.

Rules apply to every session, including admins. A topic must be covered by at
most one rule, hashing without a secret is rejected, and both are boot-time
errors rather than a silently weaker policy. Offsets, timestamps, `sizeBytes`,
and schema ids keep describing the wire record. A record page reports
`obfuscated: true` for a covered topic, which is what the UI badges.
